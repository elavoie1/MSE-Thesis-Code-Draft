# MSE-Thesis-Code: Towards a Prototype Paleo-Detector for Supernova Neutrino and Dark Matter Detection
All code for my MSE thesis research. Feel free to contact me for further clarification or errors.

Functions used to compute track length spectra for target minerals were adapted from https://github.com/tedwards2412/SN-paleology and https://github.com/tedwards2412/paleopy
