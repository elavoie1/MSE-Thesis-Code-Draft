# MSE-Thesis-Code-Draft
All code for my MSE thesis research. Code will be refined, cleaned, and commented more clearly in the upcoming weeks, but this repository will act as part of the rough draft submission of my written thesis.

Functions used to compute track length spectra for target minerals were adapted from https://github.com/tedwards2412/SN-paleology and https://github.com/tedwards2412/paleopy
