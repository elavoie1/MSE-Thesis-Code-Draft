"Data" folder contains SRIM outputs and mineral data files to allow the "Plot Track Length Spectra.py" to run. SRIM files are created by me using SRIM, 
but you can replicate/improve them in future studies.
"plots" folder is where plot outputs get saves to
"paleo.py" is from source code - I did not create or change this but you need this file to run the code. It's a library that is needed to either import or pull from
Make sure to have all proper libraries installed!
